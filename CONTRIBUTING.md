## Action

Action is the best inspiration, contribution is the best result.

> Yes, this sentence was just made up by me. I hope express to you that the community is inclusive and open, and it is a relaxed environment.

### Choose a Topic

If you find a bug in the code, or something that can be improved, or invalid and redundant code; you can fork the project into your own repository, modify the code, and then submit the PR.

However, if you modify multiple codes at the same time, please submit them in the form of a theme, so that we can discuss separately and merge into the trunk in stages.

### How to Write Go Code

If you are new to Go, I hope [<How to Write Go Code>](https://golang.org/doc/code.html) can help you.

If you already have relevant experience, hope the following list can unify our coding style：
1. Effective Go: [https://golang.google.cn/doc/effective\_go.html](https://golang.google.cn/doc/effective\_go.html)
2. Uber Go Style Guide: [https://github.com/uber-go/guide/blob/master/style.md](https://github.com/uber-go/guide/blob/master/style.md)([译文](https://github.com/gocn/translator/blob/master/2019/w38_uber_go_style_guide.md))
3. Go Code Review Comments: [https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments)

At the same time, we have configured related robots on PR to check the syntax and code style of the code.
